# Crystal-Growth-Kobayashi
This repository contains C++ implementation for isotropic and anisotropic dendritic crystal growth as proposed by Kobayashi in "Modeling and numerical simulations of dendritic crystal growth"

A code was written that solves the two equations - one for temperature evolution and one for phase field evolution as given in the Kobayashi's paper.

To visualize the crystal structure I use MATLAB.

Explicit method for temperature equation and explicit time marching scheme for phase field simulation have been used.
